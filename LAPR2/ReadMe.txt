For the user to first login in into the application, the user needs to log in as an administrator, which there are two already registered:
Username:adm1@isep.pt
Password:a123456

Username:a
Password:a

After that you need to register an organization and then the email and password of the manager and collaborator will appear in a file named e-mail.txt in the same folder as the application.
In that folder there will be already two e-mails who are registered in a unit test so they wonâ€™t be functional.

After that the app is ready to use.
If by any reason you need to delete all the files registered just delete the _Platform.pla file.
